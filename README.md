# parametric-nam

Toolchain for converting SPICE circuit schematics (`.schx`) into **parametric**
Neural Amp Modeler (NAM) files. The resulting `.param.nam` captures a circuit's
behavior across its **full knob range** — enabling real-time parametric inference
in [redacted] at a fraction of the CPU cost of live simulation.

Given a `.schx` (e.g. an amp or pedal from `LiveSPICE-Amp-Collection`), it simulates
the circuit across a sweep of knob settings, trains a FiLM-conditioned WaveNet on the
paired audio, and exports a single `.param.nam` whose knobs match the real controls.

## Quick Start

**This repo is not self-contained.** It needs sibling checkouts. Clone them side by side:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/work && cd ~/work

gh repo clone mrgeneko/parametric-nam        # this repo — the toolchain
gh repo clone mrgeneko/parametric-devices      # the .schx library + devices.toml registry — PRIVATE
gh repo clone mrgeneko/sweep-files         # the training sweeps (licence-restricted — see its README) — PRIVATE
gh repo clone mrgeneko/parametric-nam-models    # where trained runs are archived — PRIVATE

# THE ORACLE (livespice_cli) — public, no PRIVATE-repo auth needed. Recursive: it has its own
# nested submodule.
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mrgeneko/livespice-cli

cd parametric-nam && ./setup.sh && . .venv/bin/activate
```

`setup.sh` builds the oracle from `../livespice-cli` (needs the .NET SDK; `--no-cli` to
skip) and creates the venv. If your checkouts are not siblings, point at them explicitly:

```bash
export LIVESPICE_CLI=/path/to/livespice-cli/publish/livespice_cli
```

### Train a device

```bash
python run_pipeline.py --config configs/big-muff-v1.toml \
    --dataset-dir    ~/work/tmp/bigmuff_ds \
    --nam-output     ~/work/tmp/bigmuff.param.nam \
    --checkpoint-dir ~/work/tmp/bigmuff_ckpt
```

One command runs **four** steps:

| step | what it does | why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Grid adequacy** | renders each knob cell's midpoint and checks the grid can represent the target ESR | a too-coarse cell puts a floor under the model that **no training can lift**. Aborts in ~2 min instead of wasting hours. |
| 1 — Generate | renders the dataset across the knob grid | |
| 2 — Combine | per-permutation WAVs → `outputs.npy` | |
| 3 — Train | FiLM-conditioned WaveNet → `.param.nam` + release folder | prints the **training budget** in gradient steps |

**Adding a *new* device? Read [`docs/adding-a-device.md`](docs/adding-a-device.md)** — it walks the
whole recipe, and every step in it exists because skipping it produced a quietly wrong model.

### Listen

```bash
python param_infer.py --checkpoint ~/work/tmp/bigmuff_ckpt/best.pt \
    --input dry.wav --output-dir /tmp/out/ --params "Sustain=0.7,Tone=0.4"
```

## How it works

```
.schx schematic
    ↓  batch_harness.py        (simulate: input sweep × N knob permutations)
Paired audio dataset (config.json, sweep.wav, outputs.npy, params.csv)
    ↓  param_train.py          (train A2 Lite 3ch + Full 8ch jointly, FiLM knob conditioning)
.param.nam  (SlimmableContainer)
    ↓  param_infer.py          (PyTorch inference at arbitrary knob positions — no C++)
    ↓  Phase 3                 (NeuralAmpModelerCore ParametricWaveNet factory)
Real-time inference in [redacted]
```

`run_pipeline.py` orchestrates the first three steps in one command; you can also run
each script directly (below).

---

## `run_pipeline.py` — the primary entry point

Runs **generate → combine → train** as one command, with per-step timing, a durable
**release folder**, and macOS/Linux **sleep-inhibition** for long runs. Steps auto-skip
when their outputs exist (`--skip-generate/-combine/-train`, `--force-generate`).

```bash
python run_pipeline.py \
    --dataset-dir <ds> --nam-output <model.param.nam> --checkpoint-dir <ckpt> \
    --backend livespice --schx "<amp>.schx" \
    --knobs gain,tone,volume --random 200 --bounds tone=0.15,0.85 \
    --input guitar.wav --slimmable --mmap \
    --crop-len 24000 --epochs 0 --restart-period 50 --batch-size 64
```

- `--epochs 0` = **open-ended training** (see param_train) — runs until you
  `touch <ckpt>/STOP`, exporting the best model continuously.
- On completion it builds `<nam-output>_release/`: the best-full & best-lite
  `.param.nam`, the `.schx`, `metrics.csv`, a provenance `MANIFEST.md` (params +
  timing + hardware + git revs), and a runnable `reproduce.sh`. `--no-release` skips it.
- Generation flags (`--random`, `--bounds`, `--oversample`, ngspice `--koren` etc.)
  are forwarded to `batch_harness`; training flags to `param_train`.

### Per-circuit configs (`--config`)

A circuit's *recipe* — schematic, input, knob grid, fixed params, widths, and
hyperparameters — lives in a declarative TOML under [`configs/`](configs/), so the
pipeline stays generic (one `run_pipeline.py`, one small reviewable file per circuit)
instead of a script per `.schx`. Only the per-run output paths stay on the CLI:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py --config configs/big-muff-v1.toml \
    --dataset-dir /tmp/bigmuff_ds --nam-output /tmp/bigmuff.param.nam \
    --checkpoint-dir /tmp/bigmuff_ckpt
```

Any CLI flag overrides the config (config is loaded as argparse defaults). The `[knobs]`
table (`NAME = [v1, v2, …]`) expands to `--knobs`/`--range`, `[fixed]` to
`--fixed-params`, and `widths = [3,4,8]` to `--widths`. See `configs/big-muff-v1.toml`
for a worked example (with the reasoning behind the knob sampling).

## Scripts

### `batch_harness.py` — generate the dataset

Simulates the circuit across knob permutations, one WAV per permutation, then combines
them into `outputs.npy`.

```bash
# List the pots/switches in a schx:
python batch_harness.py --backend livespice --schx "<circuit>.schx"

# Grid sweep (factorial — fine for 1–3 knobs):
python batch_harness.py --backend livespice --schx "<circuit>.schx" \
    --knobs drive,tone --range "drive=0,0.5,1" --range "tone=0.2,0.5,0.8" \
    --input guitar.wav --output <ds> --dry-run   # check perm count + disk first

# Random sampling (for high knob counts — grids explode past ~3 knobs):
python batch_harness.py --backend livespice --schx "<amp>.schx" \
    --knobs gain,bass,mid,treble,master --random 200 \
    --bounds bass=0.15,0.85 --bounds mid=0.15,0.85 --bounds treble=0.15,0.85 \
    --input guitar.wav --output <ds>

# Combine per-permutation WAVs into outputs.npy:
python batch_harness.py --combine <ds>
```

- **`--random N`** samples N points in the knob hypercube (+ deterministic boundary
  **anchors** so extremes are covered; `--no-anchors` to skip). FiLM interpolates
  between them — far better than a coarse grid for >3 knobs. Seeded (`--seed`) and
  extensible.
- **`--bounds KNOB=lo,hi`** restricts a knob's sampled range (e.g. keep a tone pot in
  its usable band, or a hot gain pot out of a divergent regime). Recorded in the
  `.param.nam` so the host maps the knob to the real trained domain.
- **`--max-crest`** (default 50) fails any permutation whose output crest factor
  (peak/RMS) exceeds it — a scale-invariant detector for numerical divergence that
  RMS/length checks miss.
- **`--fixed-params k=v,...`** pins controls not being swept; **`--speaker`** selects a
  speaker tap. Knob order in `--knobs` = knob order in the `.param.nam`.

**Ganged (multi-section) pots:** `livespice_cli` drives **every** pot/switch whose
`Name` matches the swept knob. To model a mechanically-ganged control (e.g. a dual-gang
Gain), give both `Circuit.Potentiometer` components the **same `Name`** in the `.schx`;
`--knobs Gain` then moves both wipers in lockstep, and the knob appears once downstream.

### `param_train.py` — train a parametric NAM

```bash
python param_train.py --dataset <ds> --output <model.param.nam> --checkpoint-dir <ckpt> \
    --slimmable --mmap --crop-len 24000 --batch-size 64 --repeats 8 \
    --lr 3e-4 --epochs 200
```

- **`--slimmable`** (always use it) trains an A2 **Lite 3ch + Full 8ch** jointly and
  exports both tiers in one SlimmableContainer.
- **Dual best-checkpointing**: the best-full and best-lite epochs (which differ) are
  each saved and exported live to `<output>.best_full.param.nam` /
  `<output>.best_lite.param.nam`, plus `best.pt` / `best_lite.pt` and per-epoch
  `latest.pt` + `metrics.csv`.
- **`--epochs 0`** = open-ended: trains with an SGDR (cosine-warm-restart) schedule
  until you `touch <ckpt>/STOP` (or SIGINT/SIGTERM). Best models export continuously,
  so you can stop whenever ESR is good enough. `--restart-period` sets the cycle length.
- **`--resume <ckpt>/latest.pt`** continues a run. **`--mmap`** memory-maps
  `outputs.npy` (low RAM). **`--crop-len`** is the training window; 24000 is ≫ the
  model's receptive field and ~2× faster than 48000.

### `param_infer.py` — inference (Python, no C++)

```bash
python param_infer.py --checkpoint <ckpt>/best.pt \
    --input dry.wav --output-dir out/ \
    --params "drive=0.5,tone=0.7" --params "drive=0.9,tone=0.3"
```
Loads a checkpoint and renders WAVs at arbitrary knob positions. Repeat `--params` for
multiple outputs. Knob names/order come from the dataset `config.json`.

### `coverage_report.py` — find holes in a sampled dataset

```bash
python coverage_report.py --dataset <ds> --suggest 5
```
Read-only analysis of `params.csv`: success/failure summary, **per-knob boundary
coverage**, 1-D histograms, pairwise 2-D occupancy, and nearest-neighbour **gap
analysis** (largest empty regions, optionally emitted as fill points). Pairs with the
seed-extensible sampler to grow a dataset toward its gaps.

### `export_checkpoint.py` — checkpoint → `.param.nam`

```bash
python export_checkpoint.py --checkpoint <ckpt>/latest.pt --dataset <ds> \
    --output model_final.param.nam --state model
```
Re-exports a NAM from any `.pt` (e.g. the final `latest.pt` weights) without retraining.

## Backends

**LiveSPICE** (`--backend livespice`, default) — real-time-capable, `.schx`-native,
reference tube models, uniform audio-rate output, never aborts. Use it for essentially
everything.

**ngspice** (`--backend ngspice`, experimental) — an offline real-SPICE backend with
adaptive timestepping, for the handful of **stiff / very-high-gain** circuits (e.g. the
EVH 5150 Lead full) where LiveSPICE's fixed-step solver diverges or needs extreme
oversampling. It translates any `.schx` to an ngspice netlist (exact Dempwolf–Zölzer /
Koren tube models, E+F ideal transformer) and feeds the input via an XSPICE filesource.
Tuning knobs for stiff amps: `--koren`, `--ot-damp`, `--ot-snub`, `--nfb-comp`.
See **[`ngspice/README.md`](ngspice/README.md)** for usage, the convergence findings,
and the important fidelity caveats.

## What a run produces

A **dataset** directory (`batch_harness --combine` format):
```
config.json   # {"knobs": [...], "bounds": {...}, "param_map": {...}, ...}
sweep.wav     # the dry input used
outputs.npy   # [N_perms, N_samples] float32
params.csv    # idx, knob1, ..., rms, peak, ok, error
```

A **release folder** (`<nam-output>_release/`, built by `run_pipeline`): the shipped
`.best_full.param.nam` + `.best_lite.param.nam`, the `.schx`, `metrics.csv`,
`MANIFEST.md` (provenance: params, per-step timing, hardware, git revisions), and a
runnable `reproduce.sh`.

---

## Reference

### `.param.nam` format

A standard NAM JSON with `"SlimmableContainer"` as the outer architecture (already
registered in NeuralAmpModelerCore). Each submodel uses `"ParametricWaveNet"` — a
custom architecture Phase 3 registers.

```json

        "model": {

                {"name": "mid",          "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "default": 0.5},
                {"name": "clean_master", "min": 0.0, "max": 1.0, "default": 0.5}
              ]
            }
          },
          "weights": [...]
        }
      },
      {
        "max_value": 1.0,
        "model": { "architecture": "ParametricWaveNet", "config": {"layers": 8, ...}, "weights": [...] }
      }
    ]
  },
  "sample_rate": 48000
}
```

`config.parametric.parameters` is the authoritative knob list. Array order = UI
presentation order. All values normalized 0.0–1.0. `"layers"` is the **channel count**
(3 or 8), not a layer count — there are always 23 layers. `min`/`max` per knob come from
the dataset `--bounds`, so the host maps the control to the real trained domain.

**Key design point**: `condition_size` is the number of knobs fed to FiLM. Audio flows
through `input_mixin` separately (always 1-dim) — knobs never mix with audio.

### Architecture

A2 is a WaveNet variant: 23-layer dilated causal convnet with LeakyReLU and a Conv1D
head. `ParametricWaveNet` adds FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) on every layer,
conditioned on the knob vector. FiLM is initialized to identity (gamma=1, beta=0) so
training starts from a well-behaved unconditional baseline.

Key constants (must match NeuralAmpModelerCore's A2 fast path exactly):
- 23 layers: 14 × kernel=6, then 2 × kernel=15, then 7 × kernel=6
- Dilations: repeating [1,3,7,17,41,101,239] with {1,13} degridding insert
- LeakyReLU(0.01) on every layer
- Head: Conv1D kernel=16

Weight layout per layer (for C++ `set_weights_` compatibility):
```
conv.weight → conv.bias → mixin.weight → l1x1.weight → l1x1.bias → film.weight → film.bias
```
Then after all 23 layers: `head.weight → head.bias → head_scale`.

### NAM ecosystem compatibility

Verified against `sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler` + `NeuralAmpModelerCore` (2026-07):

- **Our A2 *is* NAM's official "A2" config** — `K_KERNEL_SIZES`/`K_DILATIONS`,
  LeakyReLU/non-gated, `condition_size=1`, widths `[3,8]` all match NAM's
  `config_model_packed.json`. A **static** (no-FiLM) A2 is literally a standard NAM
  model → exports as `"WaveNet"` / `"SlimmableContainer"` and loads in the stock
  plugin. (See `docs/spice_static_plan.md`.)
- **`"ParametricWaveNet"` is our custom extension** (A2 + FiLM for knobs) and stays
  internal to [redacted]. **Standard NAM plugins cannot drive user knobs**: the core's
  public API is `process(input, output, num_frames)` — audio in/out, *no* parameter
  argument, and no `SetParam`/`SetCondition` anywhere. NAM's own FiLM/`condition_dsp`
  is *input-derived* architecture, not a knob interface. So re-serializing parametric
  models "to match NAM" would **not** make them plugin-controllable.
- **Delivering parametric tones to standard plugins = snapshot baking.** FiLM is
  affine over the layer's linear ops, so freezing a knob setting folds `γ,β` exactly
  into `conv.weight/bias` + `mixin.weight`, yielding an identical *static* A2 with no
  FiLM. [redacted] keeps live knobs; "export this tone" bakes the setting into a
  stock-standard `.nam`. Works on **already-trained** parametric `.nam`s offline (no
  retrain) — pure weight transform.

### ESR targets

Validation ESR (error-to-signal ratio) as a rough quality guide:

| ESR | Quality |
|---|---|
| < 0.01 | Good |
| < 0.005 | Excellent |
| < 0.003 | Exceptional (JCM800 single-param achieved 0.003) |

Treat these as a sanity check, not a substitute for listening — a model's
perceptual quality and its full-band ESR can diverge quite a bit,
especially on high-gain amps (see [`docs/evh5150_training_notes.md`](docs/evh5150_training_notes.md)).

---

## System Requirements

Training parametric NAM models is GPU- and memory-intensive. Below are guidelines
based on real-world testing.

### Minimum (CPU training, works but slow)

- **RAM**: 18 GB — sufficient for dataset generation (48 permutations, 60s sweep)
  and CPU training.
- **GPU**: none — CPU-only training works reliably.
- **Training speed**: ~80 s/epoch for a 4-width slimmable model (3,4,5,8ch) at
  batch-size 16, crop-len 24000, 60s sweep.
- **200 epochs**: ~4–5 hours on CPU.

### Recommended (GPU training)

- **GPU VRAM**: 16 GB+ — needed for comfortable training of slimmable models
  with 4 widths at batch-size 16+.
- **System RAM**: 24 GB+.

### Notes for AMD GPU users

PyTorch's ROCm build may lack compiled kernels for certain GPU architectures.
If you encounter `rocBLAS` errors or `illegal memory access` on an AMD GPU
(e.g. Radeon RX 6400, gfx1034), two workarounds are needed:

1. **Missing `TensileLibrary.dat`** — create a symlink to the fallback database:
   ```bash
   ln -s TensileLibrary_Type_4xi8I_HPA_Contraction_l_Ailk_Bjlk_Cijk_Dijk_fallback.dat \
         /path/to/torch/lib/rocblas/library/TensileLibrary.dat
   ```

2. **Override GPU architecture** — set this environment variable before running
   training (maps gfx1034 → gfx1030, which has precompiled kernels):
   ```bash
   export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0
   ```

3. **Symlink missing architecture kernels** — create gfx1034 → gfx1030 symlinks
   so rocBLAS and MIOpen find suitable code objects for the actual GPU:
   ```bash
   LIBDIR="/path/to/torch/lib/rocblas/library"
   for f in "$LIBDIR"/*gfx1030*; do
     base=$(basename "$f")
     target="${base/gfx1030/gfx1034}"
     [ ! -e "$LIBDIR/$target" ] && ln -s "$base" "$LIBDIR/$target"
   done
   ```

Even with these workarounds, GPUs with only 4 GB VRAM (e.g. RX 6400) are
**not sufficient** for training slimmable WaveNet models — they consistently
fail with `illegal memory access` regardless of batch size or crop length.
Use CPU training on such hardware.

---

## Build & Dependencies

**The easy path is `./setup.sh`** (see Quick Start) — it does everything below
idempotently. The manual steps are documented here for reference / troubleshooting.

### Python packages
Pinned in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) (torch, numpy, scipy, soundfile):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For NVIDIA CUDA, install the matching `torch` build from the PyTorch index first
(see the note at the top of `requirements.txt`), then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### .NET SDK + the oracle (for dataset generation)

`livespice_cli` — **the oracle** — lives in
[**`mrgeneko/livespice-cli`**](https://github.com/mrgeneko/livespice-cli), a small standalone
public repo, not here. This repo used to carry its own near-copy, and the two drifted, as
duplicates do: a fix making an unknown `--params` name a hard error (instead of silently
rendering at the defaults, so every "swept" permutation comes out **identical** and the trainer
learns the knob does nothing) landed in one copy and not the other. Two tools built from one
schematic, disagreeing about what the device's knobs *are*. There is now exactly one. (It was
originally extracted from `hotspice/oracle/` — same reasoning, promoted to its own repo since it
has no other functional connection to this project or to hotspice's emitter.)

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mrgeneko/livespice-cli   # as a SIBLING of this repo
cd livespice-cli && ./build.sh
```
(.NET 10 SDK: `apt install dotnet-sdk-10.0` on Linux, `brew install dotnet` on macOS. `--recurse-submodules`
matters — LiveSPICE has its own nested submodule; a plain clone leaves it empty and the build fails.)

`batch_harness.py` resolves the binary in this order: **`$LIVESPICE_CLI`** → a sibling
`../livespice-cli/publish/livespice_cli`. Set the env var if your checkout lives
elsewhere.

The oracle builds against **pristine upstream LiveSPICE**, never a patched fork — an oracle built
from the thing under test is not an oracle — and `build.sh` warns if it finds fork markers in the
submodule (a sign the pin points somewhere other than pristine upstream).

> **The micro-sign patch is gone, and deliberately.** LiveSPICE's `Quantity` parser knows
> `U+03BC GREEK MU` (and ASCII `u`) but *not* `U+00B5 MICRO SIGN`, so upstream reads `4.7µF`
> written with U+00B5 as **4.7 farads** — no throw, no warning, every capacitor a dead short, and
> the simulation confidently wrong. We used to patch a vendored LiveSPICE fork, which is
> incompatible with keeping the oracle pristine. `livespice_cli` now **normalises U+00B5 → U+03BC
> when it loads the schematic**, so both encodings render bit-identically and no fork is needed.
> (Our library currently uses U+03BC in 6 of 23 files and U+00B5 in none — but U+00B5 is what most
> editors emit, so this was one save-from-the-wrong-tool away from a corrupted dataset.)

### ngspice (only for `--backend ngspice`)
```bash
apt install ngspice        # Linux;  macOS: brew install ngspice
```

### NeuralAmpModelerCore (Phase 3 only)
Not required for training or Python inference — only for C++ inference validation and
[redacted] integration.

> **Input formats**: any WAV (16/24/32-bit) and any content read correctly — an earlier
> O(N²) bug in `livespice_cli`'s WAV reader (fixed in `fa90d57`) once made non-24-bit
> inputs stall.
>
> **Training input — use a comprehensive coverage signal, and enough of it.** The
> standard NAM capture sweep (the one used to train most public NAM models) is the
> right choice: it spans the amp's input space (amplitude, frequency, transients). A
> single guitar DI is only a *subset* of that coverage. And don't skimp on length —
> training a high-gain amp (5150) on a **30 s slice** of the sweep left the model
> unable to clean up on darker/more-dynamic real playing (false breakup). Use the
> full sweep. See [`docs/evh5150_training_notes.md`](docs/evh5150_training_notes.md).

  - **Dempwolf–Zölzer** triode model — K. Dempwolf & U. Zölzer, *"A physically-motivated
    triode model for circuit simulations,"* Proc. DAFx-11 (2011) — the default triode model.
- **[Neural Amp Modeler](https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler)** /
  **[NeuralAmpModelerCore](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerCore)**
  (Steven Atkinson, MIT) — the `.nam` format, the WaveNet ("A2") architecture, and the
  `SlimmableContainer` that this project targets.
- **[auraloss](https://github.com/csteinmetz1/auraloss)** (Christian Steinmetz, Apache-2.0)
  — the multi-resolution STFT loss in `param_train.py`.
- **Ideal-transformer technique** — the ngspice output transformer uses the standard
  controlled-source (E+F) ideal-transformer method; the specific center-tapped
  equations are ported from LiveSPICE (above).

Underlying scientific-Python stack: PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, soundfile.
